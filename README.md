# Spotify Web App (Under Development - Local Only)

# Welcome to Wrapify! ðŸŽ¶

This is a work-in-progress local project, created with a strong passion for both music and development. This project allows users to explore Spotify data in ways that are not available on the official Spotify app.

## About the Project  
As someone who's always been passionate about music, this app allows me to explore music data in a more meaningful way. I wanted to dive deeper into the world of music APIs, and what better way to do that than by building a web app that interacts with Spotifyâ€™s data and song lyrics.

### **Current Access Restrictions**
The app is currently under development and can only be used locally by selected users until Spotify approves its transition out of development mode. 

## **Features**
- **View Top Played Songs**: Explore your top played songs across different time frames to get insights ahead of Spotify's annual Wrapped feature.
- **Live Lyrics**: Get live lyrics based on what you're listening to. Please note that not all songs on Spotify have lyrics available.

## **Learning Journey**  
Building this web app has been a fantastic learning experience. Iâ€™ve learned many new skills throughout the development process, including:

- **Spotify API**: Accessing and using Spotify's data in real time to offer personalized insights.  
- **Lyric API**: Integrating song lyrics to enhance the user experience.  
- **Frontend Development**: Working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and engaging user interface.

## **Future Improvements**
- **Music Recommendations**: More personalized features, like recommendations based on listening patterns.  
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Further improving the user interface for a more seamless experience.  

Stay tuned for updates as Wrapify evolves!

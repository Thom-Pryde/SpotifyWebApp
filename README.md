# Spotify Web App (Under Development - Local Only)

# Welcome to Wrapify! ðŸŽ¶

This is a work-in-progress local project, created with a strong passion for both music and development. This project allows users to explore Spotify data in ways that are not available on the official Spotify app.

## About the Project

As someone who's always been passionate about music, this app allows me to explore music data in a more meaningful way. I wanted to dive deeper into the world of music APIs, and what better way to do that than by building a web app that interacts with Spotifyâ€™s data and song lyrics.

### **Current Access Restrictions**

This web app is still under development and actively being updated. For further testing, it is currently live and accessible to select users only until Spotify approves its transition out of development mode.

## **Features**

- **View Top Played Songs**: Explore your top played songs across different time frames to get insights ahead of Spotify's annual Wrapped feature.
- **Live Lyrics**: Get live, synced lyrics for the songs you're listening toâ€”covering tracks even when Spotify doesn't provide them.
- **Song Recommendations (Coming Soon)**: Personalised song suggestions based on your listening habits. -**More Features on the Way**: Stay tuned for exciting updates, including playlist insights, music discovery tools, and more!

## **Learning Journey**

Building this web app has been a fantastic learning experience. Iâ€™ve learned many new skills throughout the development process, including:

- **Spotify API**: Accessing and using Spotify's data in real time to offer personalised insights.
- **Lyric API**: Integrating song lyrics to enhance the user experience.
- **Frontend Development**: Working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and engaging user interface.

## **Future Improvements**

- **Music Recommendations**: More personalised features, like recommendations based on listening patterns.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Further improving the user interface for a more seamless experience.

Stay tuned for updates as Wrapify evolves!
